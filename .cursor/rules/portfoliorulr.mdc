ALways use Tailwind CSS but use them in .css file and in the HTML follow BEM styling.
In the BEM classes in CSS, use @apply to the tailwind classes.

Do not commit code to github and do not suggest it too.

Do not write code that could lead to XSS attacks or SQL injection. 

This is a Next.js project, so think of adding generic components and using them.
For example, if a similar button is being used in multiple places, then extract the code to a generic button component and use that everywhere. 

Always use tsx/typescript
